CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) provides tools for exploring and analyzing multidimensional data, particularly data from high-throughput, image-based experiments analyzed by its companion image analysis software, CellProfiler.

CellProfiler Analystâ€™s primary tools:

* **Image Gallery** displays images interactively with other tools.

* **Classifier** can be quickly trained using supervised machine learning to recognize complicated and subtle distinctions between objects in images, enabling automatic scoring of hundreds of millions of objects.

* **Plate Viewer** is a tool for exploration of data according to the spatial layout of the experiment, such as a multi-well plate or microarray.

* **Scatter Plot**, **Histogram**, and **Density Plot** display numerical data.

* **Table Viewer** displays numerical and text data in a spreadsheet format, where data points can be clicked to display images.

* **Normalization Tool** creates a new datatable with normalized and feature-selected columns

The CellProfiler project is based at the Broad Institute Imaging Platform. It was started by `Anne E. Carpenter <http://www.broadinstitute.org/~anne/>`_ and `Thouis (Ray) Jones <http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/thouis-ray-jones>`_
in the laboratories of David M. Sabatini and Polina Golland at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT's CSAIL. `David Dao <http://daviddao.de>`_ currently leads the development of CellProfiler Analyst. CellProfiler Analyst is tested on MacOS 10.10 and 10.11, and Windows 7, and to a lesser extent Linux. Running the software from Linux currently requires use of the source code, which is beyond the scope of this document.

CellProfiler Analyst is distributed under the BSD-3 Clause (see LICENSE.txt).
